Entry Point
-----------
The entry point to the application is MainActivity.cs which is in the
Presentation/Activities folder.

This activity holds the OnCreate method which sets the Activities Content
to a new OverallLayout object (stored in the Presentation/Layouts folder).

Its PostCreate method tells the OverallLayout to display the splash
screen.

Database creation & Transaction file processing
-----------------------------------------------
The next call is to the layouts DoStartUp method which checks to see if
the database exists, if it doesn't then the splash screen displays
"Initializing Database..." - the database is then created and populated
with the Xml files found in the Assets folder (Components.xml and
Variations.xml).

Once the database is created (only the first time the application is run)
the next thing that happens is the processing of any transaction files that
have not already been processed (the database keeps track of processed
transaction files).  "Processing Transaction Files..." is displayed by the
splash screen during this process.

The creation of a new transaction file is then implemented that will store
any transactions for the current session.

OverallLayout Fundamentals
--------------------------

The OverallLayout object has a SetLayout method that is passed an Layout enum
value which selected the layout to display - these classes are stored in the 
Presentation/Layouts folder.
